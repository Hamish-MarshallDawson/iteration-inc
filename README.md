# Smart Care Home Platform

This platform was developed from September 2024 to April 2025 for the Software engineering group project. The main concept was to showcase a prototype for a live platform that could be implemented in actual care homes with the following features:

* Manager, Admin, and Resident profiles with different abilities for each profile
* Account creation and security verification system  
* Live database that saves the status of all devices, their names, and room locations
* Energy usage monitoring and graphing capabilities
* Achievement system with eco-friendly rewards
* User profile and password management

The resulting system is deployment-ready - with minimal code changes and a live server, it could become a fully operational application for real care home environments.
